BREAKING
********

Behavior Changes
================

Lowercase HTTP Method Name
--------------------------

For historical reasons, the framework used HTTP method names in lower case like
"get", "post".
But the method token is case-sensitive because it might be used as a gateway
to object-based systems with case-sensitive method names. By convention,
standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-ASCII letters.
See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-overview.

Now the framework uses the correct HTTP method names like "GET", "POST".

- ``Request::getMethod()`` returns uppercase HTTP methods.
- ``CURLRequest::request()`` does not change the accepted HTTP methods to uppercase.

See :ref:`upgrade-450-lowercase-http-method-name` for details.

Filter Execution Order
----------------------

The order in which Controller Filters are executed has changed. See
:ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-450-filter-execution-order>` for details.

Nested Route Groups and Options
-------------------------------

Due to a bug fix, the behavior has changed so that options passed to the outer
``group()`` are merged with the options of the inner ``group()``.
See :ref:`Upgrading Guide <upgrade-450-nested-route-groups-and-options>` for details.

Factories class
---------------

:doc:`../concepts/factories` has been changed to a final class. It is a static
class, and even if it were extended, there is no way to replace it.

Others
------

- **AutoRouting Legacy:** Changed so that a ``PageNotFoundException`` is thrown
  if the controller corresponding to the request URI does not exist.
- **Logger:** The :php:func:`log_message()` function and the logger methods in
  ``CodeIgniter\Log\Logger`` now do not return ``bool`` values. The return types
  have been fixed to ``void`` to follow the PSR-3 interface.
- **Autoloader:** The prefix ``\`` in the fully qualified classname returned by
  ``FileLocator::findQualifiedNameFromPath()`` has been removed.
- **BaseModel:** The ``getIdValue()`` method has been changed to ``abstract``.

Interface Changes
=================

.. note:: As long as you have not extended the relevant CodeIgniter core classes
    or implemented these interfaces, all these changes are backward compatible
    and require no intervention.

- **ResponseInterface:** The default value of the third parameter ``$expire`` of
  the ``ResponseInterface::setCookie()`` has been fixed from ``''`` to ``0``.
- **Logger:** The `psr/log <https://packagist.org/packages/psr/log>`_ package has
  been upgraded to v2.0.0.

.. _v450-method-signature-changes:

Method Signature Changes
========================

Setting Cookies
---------------

The third parameter ``$expire`` in :php:func:`set_cookie()` and
:php:meth:`CodeIgniter\\HTTP\\Response::setCookie()` has been fixed.

The type has been changed from ``string`` to ``int``, and the default value has
been changed from ``''`` to  ``0``.

FileLocatorInterface
--------------------

- **Router:** The first parameter of the ``RouteCollection`` constructor has been changed
  from ``FileLocator`` to ``FileLocatorInterface``.
- **View:** The third parameter of the ``View`` constructor has been changed
  from ``FileLocator`` to ``FileLocatorInterface``.

Return Type Changes
-------------------

- **Model:** The return type of the ``objectToRawArray()`` method in the ``Model``
  and ``BaseModel`` classes has been changed from ``?array`` to ``array``.

Traditional Validation Rules
----------------------------

To add ``declare(strict_types=1)`` to the framework codebase, the method parameter
type ``?string`` for a value to validate in the all Traditional Validation rule
classes ``CodeIgniter\Validation\FormatRules`` and ``CodeIgniter\Validation\Rules``
are removed.

For example, the method signature changed as follows::

    Before: public function integer(?string $str = null): bool
    After:  public function integer($str = null): bool

Others
------

- **Logger:** The method signatures of the methods in ``CodeIgniter\Log\Logger``
  that implements the PSR-3 interface have been fixed. The ``bool`` return
  types are changed to ``void``. The ``$message`` parameters now have
  ``string|Stringable`` types.

Helpers and Functions
=====================

.. _v450-required-filters:

Required Filters
================

New :ref:`Required Filters <filters-required>` have been introduced. They are
special filters that are applied before and after other kinds of filters, and
always applied even if a route does not exist.

The following existing functionalities have been reimplemented as Required Filters.

- :ref:`Force Global Secure Requests <forcehttps>`
- :doc:`../general/caching`
- :ref:`performancemetrics`
- :ref:`the-debug-toolbar`

The Benchmark **Timers** used by Debug Toolbar now collect *Required Before Filters*
and *Required After Filters* data.

The benchmark points have been changed:

- Before

   - ``bootstrap``: Creating Request and Response objects, Event ``pre_system``, Instantiating RouteCollection object, Loading Routes files, Instantiating Router object,
   - ``routing``: Routing,
- After

   - ``bootstrap``: Creating Request and Response objects, Event ``pre_system``.
   - ``required_before_filters``: Instantiating Filters object, Running *Required Before Filters*.
   - ``routing``: Instantiating RouteCollection object, Loading Routes files, Instantiating Router object, Routing,

Others
======

  that allows using CamelCase controller and method names. See
  :ref:`controller-translate-uri-to-camelcase`.
- **Autoloader:**
    - Autoloading performance when using Composer has been improved.
      Adding the ``App`` namespace in the ``autoload.psr4`` setting in **composer.json**
      may also improve the performance of your app. See :ref:`autoloader-application-namespace`.
    - FileLocator Caching implemented. See :ref:`file-locator-caching` for details.
    - ``FileLocatorInterface`` has been added.
- **CodeIgniter:** Added a pseudo-variable ``{memory_usage}`` to show your memory
  usage in your view files, which was supported by CodeIgniter 3.
- **CSP:** Added ``ContentSecurityPolicy::clearDirective()`` method to clear
  existing CSP directives. See :ref:`csp-clear-directives`.
