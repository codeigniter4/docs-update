## Breaking Changes

### base_url()

The `base_url()` behavior has been fixed. In previous versions, when you
call `base_url()` **without argument**, it returned baseURL without a
trailing slash (`/`). Now it returns baseURL with a trailing slash. For
example:

- before: `http://example.com`
- after: `http://example.com/`

If you have code to call `base_url()` without argument, you may need to
adjust the URLs.

### uri_string()

The `uri_string()` behavior has been fixed. In previous versions, when
you navigate to the baseURL, it returned `/`. Now it returns an empty
string (`''`).

If you have code to call `uri_string()`, you may need to adjust it.

> [!NOTE]
> The `uri_string()` returns a URI path relative to baseURL. It is not a
> full URI path if the baseURL contains subfolders. If you use it for
> HTML links, it is better to use it with `site_url()` like
> `site_url(uri_string())`.

## Mandatory File Changes

### composer.json

If you have installed CodeIgnter manually and are using or planning to
use Composer, remove the following line:

``` text
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "CodeIgniter\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate"  <-- Remove this line
        ],
        "test": "phpunit"
    },
    ...
}
```

## Project Files

Some files in the **project space** (root, app, public, writable)
received updates. Due to these files being outside of the **system**
scope they will not be changed without your intervention.

There are some third-party CodeIgniter modules available to assist with
merging changes to the project space: [Explore on
Packagist](https://packagist.org/explore/?query=codeigniter4%20updates).

### Content Changes

The following files received significant changes (including deprecations
or visual adjustments) and it is recommended that you merge the updated
versions with your application:

- app/Config/Mimes.php
- app/Views/errors/html/error_exception.php
- composer.json
- public/.htaccess

### All Changes

This is a list of all files in the **project space** that received
changes; many will be simple comments or formatting that have no effect
on the runtime:

- app/Config/App.php
- app/Config/Mimes.php
- app/Views/errors/html/error_exception.php
- composer.json
- public/.htaccess
