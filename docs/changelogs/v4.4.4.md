## BREAKING

### Validation with Dot Array Syntax

A validation rule with the wildcard `*` now validates only data in
correct dimensions as "dot array syntax". See
`Upgrading <upgrade-444-validation-with-dot-array-syntax>` for details.

### Validation rules matches and differs

Bugs have been fixed in the case where `matches` and `differs` in the
Strict and Traditional rules validate data of non-string types.

### The use of the <span class="title-ref">ssl_key</span> option in CURLRequest was removed

Due to a bug, we were using the undocumented
<span class="title-ref">ssl_key</span> config option to define the CA
bundle in CURLRequest. This was fixed and is now working according to
documentation. You can define your CA bundle via the
<span class="title-ref">verify</span> option.

### Filesystem Helper

`get_filenames()` now follows symlink folders, which it previously just
returned without following.

## Message Changes

- Added `HTTP.invalidJSON` error message.
- Added `HTTP.unsupportedJSONFormat` error message.

## Changes

## Deprecations

- **Request:** The `CodeIgniter\\HTTP\\Request::getEnv()` method is
  deprecated. This method does not work from the beginning. Use `env()`
  instead.

## Bugs Fixed

- **CURLRequest:** Fixed a bug where the hostname was checked even if
  options 'verify' was set to *false*.

See the repo's
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)
